# Sorting algorithms

Collection of different and basic sorting algorithms in C language, you can also find a file with the time complexity of each sorting algorithm, with the following examples:

O(1)

O(n)

O(n!)

n square -> O(n^2)

log(n) -> O(log(n))

n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))

n + k -> O(n+k)

# Bubble sort

Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case time complexity is quite high.

Here you can see an example of you can compile it and use it, also you can see the process of the bubble sorting algorithm.

# Insertion sort

Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands. The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.

Image of how to compile the insertion sort algorithm.

# Selection sort

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

Another example of how to compile and how the selection sort works.

# Quick sort

QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.
